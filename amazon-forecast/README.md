# Amazon Forecast

Following a hands-on experience with one of my clients, I had published an online e-learning course on **Amazon Forecast**, a service used for generating time series forecasts. Unfortunately Amazon has since discontinued this service.

As often happens when major tech companies retire tools without notice, I found myself having invested considerable time in something that now needs to be restructured or replaced.

Despite this setback, the course still contains many valuable insights into **machine learning** concepts in general. For this reason, I am sharing the original course materials here in this repository, as they may still be helpful to others interested in the topic.
